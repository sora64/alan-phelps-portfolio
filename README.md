Web Development Portfolio for Alan Phelps

I have created a portfolio to display my work. It contains a navigation header, a hero with an introductory message and a picture of me, a short bio, a couple of links with pictures to my completed projects, a list of ways to contact me, a link to my resume, and an appropriate footer. I will add to this portfolio as I complete more projects.

Thank you to https://dev.to/devggaurav/let-s-build-a-responsive-navbar-and-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-4gci for the help with making my nav elements into a hamburger on mobile!
